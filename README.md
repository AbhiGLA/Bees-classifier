# Bees-classifier
We had to classify whether the bees were honeybee or Bumblebee . 
Dataset was in the form of images which consisted of both Bombus and Apes.
The bees here are naive as they don't know which class they belong to.
Used various Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest , SVM, K-Nearest Neigbor, etc.
It was a part of Mini Project.
Finally Classified them on the basis of acuracy of the best classifier.
